This is my code repository for the Data Science capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate from Coursera. This project is based on a hypothetical competitor to SpaceX, whose goal is to make a model that predicts whether a booster landing will be successful or not.

You can find the notebooks for various sections of the project, which tested my abilities with Data Acquisition, Data Wrangling, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning. I used Python and SQL to analyze the data and predict the outcome of a booster landing with 88.9% accuracy. The pdf file contains the slides that summarizes the contents of all the notebooks in the repository.
